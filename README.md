BBC Micro emulator for Android - based on Beebdroid

This app is designed to be used with a hardware keyboard – if you just want to play on your phone with an on-screen keyboard/joypad you should install Beebdroid (this app uses Beebdroid’s emulation code).

If you do put the effort in this app will give you the best BBC Micro experience possible, the minimum you’ll need is a Bluetooth keyboard. You can also use a Playstation controller by adding a USB On-the-go adapter. Add a HDMI cable and you can play on your TV. With an Android compatible USB hub you can have a fullscreen experience on your TV and still use modern gamepad.

As BBC Micro games are very small by todays standards I’ve packaged them into the .apk itself, this makes the app 25.7mb but it means you don’t need any network connection to have access to the full historical collection of games. The games are taken from the archived Stairway to Hell resource (which we’ve also mirrored on the Fiskur BBC Micro Catalogue), if you’re a rights-holder and want any of the content removing please get in touch.

- Tap the screen to toggle between fullscreen and menu mode
- Emulation pauses when the menu is open

- All games now packaged within the app
- Updated UI to Android Lollipop/Material Design

Known issues:

This project uses the emulation of Beebdroid (which is Open Source) but fixes several UX issues present in the original project by LittleFluffyToys, Beebdroid is available at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.littlefluffytoys.beebdroid LittleFluffyToys are not happy about this work and feel I should have submitted a pull request instead - if you compare source (or just use both apps) you'll see that other than the core emulation the app is completely different. I first learned they were unhappy in March 2014; their project had not been updated since February 2012, in December 2014 they continued developing Beebdroid.
